        <p>Hi! I'm pond. browse my portfolio by using the navigation sidebar. Feel free to DM me on <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/1184893771285004348">discord</a>.
            <br><br>
            Most of my commission work is priced at a Â£10/hr hourly rate. Feel free to get in contact via discord if you have an idea or want to brainstorm.
            <br>Don't be scared, I am a friendly goose! ðŸ©·ðŸª¿

        <h1>Mini CV/Resume</h1>
        <p>
            In 2019 I completed my Art Foundation studies with a Distinction.
            <br>I was accepted into the UK's 2019 top ranking art school this same year, and studied Fine Art for one year before switching to undergraduate Computer Science.
            <br><br>I hold 5 full A'level qualifications in Art & Design, Photography, Biology, French, and Mathematics. I also hold 2 Advanced Subsidiary qualifications in History and Computer Science.
            I achieved 10 GCSEs grade A*-A.</p>

        <h1>Good to Know</h1>
        <p>My commissioned work can take a very long time to complete. Depending on the piece, it may take up to several months.
            I also don't work through my owed list linearly- work that is "ahead" or "behind" in the queue may be completed later or earlier.
            <br><br>I don't really like taking formal commissions! Making work for others is much less about the money for me than it is about having a good time creating a piece of artwork, collaborating on an idea, or having fun with a concept.
            I am open to requests! If you have an idea, feel free to share it with me. If I get inspired I may make a version of your idea, but I can't promise that I will due to time and mental load limits. Irrespective, I love talking about creative work with people and I love to hear about others' creativity, so don't be afraid to share!
            <br><br>If you want to support me or my work, I do have a ko-fi available, but can't link it for chickensmoothie policy reasons :)</p>
        <h1>Updates</h1>
        <b>Fri 23 May 2025</b> Commissions are booked up until july, but feel free to reach out anyway :)
