  <h1>Mini CV/Resume</h1>
  <p>
    In 2019 I completed my Art Foundation studies with a Distinction.
    <br>I was accepted into the UK's 2019 top ranking art school this same year, and studied Fine Art for one year before switching to undergraduate Computer Science.
    <br><br>I hold 5 full A'level qualifications in Art & Design, Photography, Biology, French, and Mathematics. I also hold 2 Advanced Subsidiary qualifications in History and Computer Science.
    I achieved 10 GCSEs grade A*-A.</p>

  <h1>Good to Know</h1>
  <p>My commissioned work can take a very long time to complete. Depending on the piece, it may take up to several months.
  I also don't work through my owed list linearly- work that is "ahead" or "behind" in the queue may be completed later or earlier.
  <br><br>I don't really like taking formal commissions! Making work for others is much less about the money for me than it is about having a good time creating a piece of artwork, collaborating on an idea, or having fun with a concept.
    I am open to requests! If you have an idea, feel free to share it with me. If I get inspired I may make a version of your idea, but I can't promise that I will due to time and mental load limits. Irrespective, I love talking about creative work with people and I love to hear about others' creativity, so don't be afraid to share!
  <br><br>If you want to support me or my work, I do have a ko-fi available, but can't link it for chickensmoothie policy reasons :)</p>
  <h1>Updates</h1>
  <b>Fri 23 May 2025</b> Commissions are booked up until july, but feel free to reach out anyway :)
